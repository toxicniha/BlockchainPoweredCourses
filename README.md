# Blockchain-Powered Online Courses

## Project Description
The **Blockchain-Powered Online Courses** project aims to revolutionize the way online courses are bought, sold, and accessed. By leveraging the power of blockchain, this platform ensures transparent transactions, verifiable certificates, and secure enrollment processes. It uses smart contracts to create, purchase, and manage courses, providing instructors with a decentralized way to offer educational content while maintaining full control over the course pricing and status.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to provide an accessible, secure, and transparent platform for both instructors and students. We aim to empower instructors to directly monetize their courses, while students can easily access and verify their enrollment. Additionally, blockchain technology ensures that there are no middlemen, which could reduce costs and improve the overall user experience for both instructors and learners.

## Key Features
- **Course Creation**: Instructors can create and list courses with a name, description, price, and course status (active or inactive).
- **Course Purchase**: Students can purchase courses through smart contracts, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.
- **Instructor Control**: Instructors can update the status of their courses (active/inactive) and receive direct payments.
- **Decentralized Enrollment System**: Students can enroll in courses and have verifiable proof of enrollment stored on the blockchain.
- **Secure Transactions**: Payments for courses are handled via Ethereum's smart contracts, ensuring safe and automated transfers of funds.

## Future Scope
- **Certificate Issuance**: Implement a feature for instructors to issue verifiable digital certificates upon course completion.
- **Token Integration**: Introduce a native token that can be used for transactions and rewards.
- **Learning Progress Tracking**: Add a feature to track student progress and provide instructors with feedback.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Extend the platform to support multiple blockchains for scalability and reduced gas fees.
- **Course Rating System**: Allow students to rate and review courses, providing valuable feedback for future learners.
